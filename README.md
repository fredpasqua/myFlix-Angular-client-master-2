# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.
The App was a rebuild of a previous project done in React. Recreating the client side that was previously built with React was a great way to explore Angular and familiarize myself with its unique syntax and to practice using TypeScript. 
The App perfoms basic CRUD operations in conjunction with the backend I created previously, which is hosted on Heroku and built with MongoDB and served up by Express.

The App allows users to: 
<ul><li>register a new account</li>
<li>login</li>
<li>manage their account info</li>
<li>browse movies</li>
<li>favorite movies</li>
<li>Learn more about directors and genres</li>
<li>View a synopsis of each film</li>
</ul>

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
